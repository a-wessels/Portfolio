**OVERVIEW**

Did some initial framing and containerization. I'm not sure I need the wire frames at this phase, since CSS can do a lof of the positioning work for me. And I'm sure my notion of what I'm going to do will change as I'm doing the CSS properties. I do see the value in it for working with teams, and will definitely practice it for the sake of a job skill.

Yesterday we were trying to do a lot all at once - messing with images, styles, js deployment etc. I'm just going through this website and building one element at a time. I'm new to JavaScript and deployments, so I'll go step by step with smaller iterations. Bear with me! üòÖ

If you don't like any of my css tags, or if I have too many, help me out!



**What I did.**

* Deleted a few files that were just junk from practicing.
* Commented out the Materialize links that I wasn't using. I'll add it back in once I've got a general layout and I need one of their elements.
* Made some containers that I'm sure will evolve as I add some content.
* Added pictures of cats. üê±

**What I did *not* do.**

* Anything with illustrator.
* Anything with JavaScript

**What's next.**

* I'll probably add some fixed nav somewhere and a couple more containers.
* Responsivenes? If I'm feeling ambitious.
